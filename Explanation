Project Overview
This project explores the application of Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) to solve a fundamental problem in computational theory 
and physics: determining the solvability of two-dimensional (2D) mazes. By treating the maze as a binary matrix where passages and 
walls are denoted by 1s and 0s respectively, this model attempts to predict whether a path from start to finish is possible.

Methodology
The research involves generating a large dataset of 2D mazes, each labeled as 'solvable' or 'unsolvable' based on Depth-first search 
(DFS) algorithm results. We utilize a CNN model trained on these data points to learn and predict the solvability of any given maze 
configuration. The CNN architecture includes multiple layers of convolution and pooling, followed by dense layers with dropout to 
prevent overfitting.

Results
Initial tests show promising results with high accuracy in classifying mazes, demonstrating the CNN's ability to capture essential 
features from the input matrices that dictate maze solvability. The project also explores the limitations of CNNs in capturing the 
global properties necessary for solving mazes, suggesting areas for further research and improvement.
